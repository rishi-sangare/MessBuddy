# MessBuddy Application

Welcome to my React Native and Expo application! This repository contains the source code for MessBuddy app developed using React Native and Expo.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- Expo CLI: Install the Expo CLI globally by running the following command:

     npm install -g expo-cli
</kbd>


## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

     cd your-repo
</kbd>

3. Install the project dependencies:
<kbd style="border-radius: 9999px; padding: 4px 10px; background-color: #EDEDED; font-family: monospace;">
     npm install
</kbd>

4. Start the Expo development server:
<kbd style="border-radius: 9999px; padding: 4px 10px; background-color: #EDEDED; font-family: monospace;">
     npm start
</kbd>

This will start the development server and display a QR code in the terminal.

5. To run the application on your physical device or emulator, you have a few options:
- Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device, scan the QR code from the terminal using the Expo Go app, and the app will open automatically.
- For iOS, you can also press `i` in the terminal to send the app URL to your email and open it directly on your device.
- For Android, you can press `a` in the terminal to open the app on an Android emulator.
